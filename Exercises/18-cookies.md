Jesse loves cookies and wants the sweetness of some cookies to be greater than value k . To do this, two cookies with the least sweetness are repeatedly mixed. This creates a special combined cookie with:

sweetness =(1× Least sweet cookie +2× 2nd least sweet cookie).

This occurs until all the cookies have a sweetness ≥k.

Given the sweetness of a number of cookies, determine the minimum number of operations required until we have all cookies with sweetness ≥k. If it is not possible, return −1.
